# From Hue to You - Creating a Customizable Color Palette with Modern CSS

In the past, creating custom themes in web applications often required the use of a CSS preprocessor like Less or Sass to generate dynamic stylesheets with variables. To persist the brand color, you might've needed to save in a database and send to client. However, with modern CSS, we no longer need a preprocessor to achieve dynamic color themes. CSS custom properties, also known as variables, provide a native way to define variables in CSS and update them dynamically with JavaScript. In this article, we'll explore their use to create a personalized web experience, without the need for a preprocessor.

The basic idea is to define a set of CSS variables that define the primary color and its various shades, tints, and gradients. Then, we'll use these variables throughout our layout, allowing users to customize the color scheme of the website without having to modify the underlying CSS code. In the past you maybe ha
Here's an example of what this might look like:

```css
:root {
	--primary-hue: 21;
	--primary-saturation: 44%;
	--primary-lightness: 55.9%;
	--primary-color: hsl(var(--primary-hue), var(--primary-saturation), var(--primary-lightness));
	--primary-color-inverted: hsl(
		var(--primary-hue),
		var(--primary-saturation),
		calc(100% - var(--primary-lightness) + 10%)
	);
	--gradient-start: var(--primary-color);
	--gradient-end: var(--primary-color-inverted);
	--gradient-background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, var(--gradient-start), var(--gradient-end));
}
```

In this example, we're using HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color values to define the primary color and its shades. We're also using the calc() function to adjust the lightness value of the primary color to create darker and lighter shades.
Once we've defined these variables, we can use them throughout our layout, like this:

```css
body {
	background: var(--gradient-background);
}
```

With this code, we can create a layout that uses the primary color and its various shades and gradients throughout. But what about allowing users to customize the color scheme?
To do this, we can use JavaScript to modify the values of the CSS variables on the fly. Here's an example:

```js
const colorPicker = document.querySelector('#color-picker');
colorPicker.addEventListener('input', (event) => {
	let [h, s, l] = hexToHSL(event.target.value);
	document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--primary-hue', h);
	document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--primary-saturation', `${s}%`);
	document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--primary-lightness', `${l}%`);
});
```

## Summary

You can see a codepen example [here](https://codepen.io/victorfoster/full/yLzgYda) where we're using an HTML color picker input to allow users to select a new primary color. When the color picker value changes, we're using JavaScript to update the --primary-hue CSS variable to the new value. And that's it! With just a few lines of code, we've created a customizable layout that users can adjust to their preferences. I hope this article has been helpful in showing how to use modern CSS to achieve what you might've need a prepoccesor achieve in the past to create a highly personalized layout.
