# Hello, I'm Victor

I am a web technologists<sup>[^1]</sup> working at Inspirato as Director, UI Engineering. I enjoy working with **inclusive** teams and crafting **beautiful** front-end experiences.

When working on product teams I love to instill a [DevOps Mindset](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/values-devops-mindset) where experimentation is encouraged and there is no friction to continuously deliver enhancements to the end-user experience. I foster a culture of **learning** on the teams I'm on and believe the web should be for everyone. I like to lead with **empathy** and believe in **autonomy**, **mastery** and **purpose**.[^3]

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, traveling, playing chess and recording music.
