# Hello, I'm Victor

I am a web technologists<sup>[^1]</sup> living in Denver, Colorado working with the wonderful folks at Inspirato as Director, UI Engineering. I enjoy working with **inclusive** teams and crafting **beautiful** front-end experiences.

As I worked on software projects over the years I developed a passion for the frontend due to the immediate impact you can often have an end-user experience. When working on product teams I love to instill a [DevOps Mindset](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/devops/) where experimentation is encouraged and **continuous delivery** is embraced. I enjoy promoting a culture of **learning** on the teams I'm on and believe the web should be for everyone. I, like others, am motived by **autonomy**, **mastery** and **purpose**<sup>[^2]</sup>.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, traveling (a lot), playing chess and working on recording projects.
