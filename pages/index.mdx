# Victor Foster

Hello, my name is Victor. I'm a frontend engineer and digital nomad living in Seattle, WA. I enjoy crafting **beautiful**, **performant**, and **accessible** web applications.

I developed a passion for the frontend due to the **empathy** required in creating **user-centered** products. I enjoy the constant learning required with the evolving web platform (I love **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**). I'm an advocate of the web and following modern best practices. I believe in embracing the [DevOps Mindset](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/10/the-rise-of-the-devops-mindset/) where **experimentation** is encouraged and **continuous delivery** is embraced.
