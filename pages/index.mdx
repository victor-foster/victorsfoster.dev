# Victor Foster

My name is Victor and I'm a frontend engineer working with the wonderful people at Inspirato as Director, UI Engineering. I enjoy building **inclusive teams** crafting **beautiful** and **performant** front-end experiences.

I developed a passion for the frontend due to the **empathy** required in creating **user-centered** products. I enjoy the constant learning required with the evolving web platform (I love **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**). Even though I've been around since the "geocities" version of the internet I encourage the teams I'm on to utilize the latest language features (I'm still not over the fact that we will have [container queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries) soon). I believe in embracing the [DevOps Mindset](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/10/the-rise-of-the-devops-mindset/) where **experimentation** is encouraged and **continuous delivery** is embraced. If you want to know more, please say [hi](mailto:victor.foster@gmail.com)!
