# Hello

I'm Victor, a web technologists<sup>[^1]</sup> currently working with the great team at Inspirato as Director, UI Engineering.  I enjoy working with inclusive teams and crafting beautiful front-end experiences.

I spend much of my time iterating on products with a **DevOps mindset**<sup>[^2]</sup> and a focus on **accessibility**, **performance** and delivering **user-centered designs**.  I'm a big believer in the **web**, **continuous learning** and leading with  **empathy**.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, traveling, playing chess and recording music.
