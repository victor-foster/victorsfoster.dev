# Hello, I'm Victor

I am a web technologists<sup>[^1]</sup> currently working at Inspirato as Director, UI Engineering.  I enjoy working with **inclusive** teams and crafting **beautiful** front-end experiences.

You may find me iterating on products with a DevOps mindset<sup>[^2]</sup> to continuously deliver **user-centered** experiences.  I foster a culture of **learning** on the teams I'm on and believe the web should be for everyone.  I like to lead with **empathy** and believe in **autonomy**, **mastery** and **purpose**.[^3]

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, traveling, playing chess and recording music.
